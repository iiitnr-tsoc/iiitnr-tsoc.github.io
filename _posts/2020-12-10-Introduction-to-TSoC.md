Hi everybody!
Welcome to The Society Of Coders. We are excited to launch the official website of TSoC. The site will be open to all the members and will be used as a portal to share knowledge and interview experiences as well as alumni talks. Let's get started!


## About the Club
TSoC is the official coding club of International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur. The consists of two major sections - **CP Wing** and **Developement Wing**. There is no barring or restriction for club entry and anybody interested in coding is a part of the club. Although, for some exceptional students, we have an elite group - **TSoC Electica** where selected students will be provided exposure to advabced topics based on their choices.

The Competitive Programming Wing (CP Wing) is dedicated to guide fresher students into the world of competitive programming and problem solving. Currently, it is led by Shyam Agarwal and Vinay Agarwal, batch of 2019. The CP wing will be taking weekly sessions to aid the students in various competitions on CodeChef and Codeforces and preparing students for competitions like ACM-ICPC and Google Kickstart. The CP Wing also organizes inter-college and intra-college coding competitions and hackathons to promote healthy competition and sporting spirit among students.


## Development Wing

 The Development Wing of TSoC is responsible for promoting software development techniques and methodologies among students. Students are free to explore their interests in any domain like Web Development or Android Development. The Development Wing will guide the students on the basics of Git, GitHub, and setting up the development environments. The Development Wing also promotes Open Source and prepares students for Open Source events like GSoC and Hacktoberfest. Students can contact the Core members, in case of doubts or confusion. Currently, the Development Wing is headed by Abhik Jain from 2019 batch.
